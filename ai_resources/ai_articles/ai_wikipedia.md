Notes on Wikipedia entry for AI

- Starts with a simple definition of AI, and gives some examples of current AI
  applications, including:

      - google search
      - recommendation systems
      - video games
      - self-driving cars
      - chatbots , eg ChatGPT

- It mentions that AI as founded as an academic discipline in 1956 but the
  it wasn't till 2012 with the advent of deep learning that it really caught
  investors interest.

  - It states that 'various sub-fields of AI research are centred around
    particualar goals and use of particualar tools. The traditional goals of AI
    research include
    _ reasoning
    _ planning
    _ learning
    _ natural language processing
    _ perception
    _ support for robotics

  With the long-term goal of 'General Intelligence' also known as 'AGI' -
  ../concepts/aig.md artificial general intelligence. There is not a consensus on the definition
  of AGI, we will go examine separately.

1.  Reason,Problemn Solving:

        Alogorithms that approximate step-by-step reasoning when solving a problem.
        This needs to address uncertain or incomplete information.
        This can lead to unmanagably large control branching. 'combinatorial
        explosion'

2.  Knowledge representation:

        This is an interesting field as it pertains to LLM, the use of
        representing knowledge as a related set of data, and grouping that data

3.  Planning and Decision Making:

4.  Learning:

5.  Natural Language Processing:
